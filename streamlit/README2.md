Due to the max storage reached on the Hugginface spaces directory, need to delete the project, and restart uploading files.

Start off by deleting the /src directory, Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and the README.md

Upload the new /app directory with the model weights, and main.py file

Then upload the Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and the README.md files.
